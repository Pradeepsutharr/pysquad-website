              transmission over the Internet or information storage technology

              improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.

              the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal

              also have the right to object to the processing of your personal
              information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using
              the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT

              implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the
              right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your
              consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details

              However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of
              the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law
              allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information

            </h3>
            <p>
              Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
              applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you
              can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
              about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
              this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and
              implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not
              currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
              that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
              online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must
              follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a
              revised version of this privacy notice.
